## Menu Maker

Menu Maker is a web application built to assist in the live updating of digital signage boards. Originally built for BuffaLouie's, a wing restaraunt in Bloomington Indiana, I eventually expanded on the functionality to the point where many different restaraunts around Bloomington utilize it to keep their menu boards updated.


I built Menu Maker while I was a manager at BuffaLouie's during my undergrad. Originally, BuffaLouie's used static images designed in Illustrator uploaded to a computer stick. However, management was not familiar with Illustrator and had a difficult time making changes to the images without my direct assistance. Additionally, the process of uploading images to the intel sticks proved to be tedious in the fast paced restaraunt environment.


After browsing other digital signage sollutions, I found that the software availible was either outdated or behind a steep paywall that wasn't ideal for our small business. Menu Maker was made over the course of 2 weeks and I gradually iterated upon it when new features came to mind. I took a mobile first approach towards the website to allow for easy updating from management's smartphones.
